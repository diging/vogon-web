                    In the humanities, making new knowledge involves reading and critically interpreting a wide range
                    of texts: books, archives, articles, images, interviews, and news clippings. Scholars share their
                    insights by arranging evidence and interpretation into books and articles that can in turn be read
                    and critically interpreted by other scholars. Sadly, much of that literature is read by only a small
                    number of people, and can be hard to find. It's even harder to validate research findings: scholars
                    cite each others' work, but practices for citing primary sources like archives vary widely. Dozens of
                    claims about historical actors or events might be covered by a single reference to an enormous archive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What if we could do better?</strong> What if the sum of our research was not just a pile of
                    papers, but a tangible network of historical actors, events, texts, and interpretations? What if we
                    could find out who claimed that Louis Agassiz disagreed with Charles Darwin, and on the basis of what
                    evidence, with the click of a mouse? Scholarly publishing has moved online. Our sources&mdash;even
                    the dusty archives&mdash;are moving online. It's time to rethink the possibilities for making human
                    knowledge in the digital age.

                <h2>Building the Epistemic Web</h2>
                <p>
                    VogonWeb is a web-based platform for encoding your interpretations of texts. The annotation interface
                    allows you to tag words or phrases with the concepts to which you believe they refer, and bring
                    those tags together into relational statements that you believe are supported by the text. These tags
                    and relations comprise the <a href="http://www.edition-open-access.de/studies/1/36/index.html">epistemic
                    web</a>: a network of texts, interpretations, and the people who create those interpretations. As
                    we build the epistemic web we are producing not only a rich knowledge-base for the humanities, but also
                    documenting the scholarly process itself.
                </p>
