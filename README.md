# VogonWeb

VogonWeb is a web-based platform for encoding your interpretations of texts.
The annotation interface allows you to tag words or phrases with the concepts to
which you believe they refer, and bring those tags together into relational
statements that you believe are supported by the text. These tags and relations
comprise the epistemic web: a network of texts, interpretations, and the people
who create those interpretations. As we build the epistemic web we are producing
not only a rich knowledge-base for the humanities, but also documenting the
scholarly process itself.

API Documentation is [here](http://diging.github.io/vogon-web/).

For deployment information, see [this ansible role](https://github.com/diging/ansible-vogon-role).
