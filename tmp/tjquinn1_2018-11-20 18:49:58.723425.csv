"Transition to a more energyefficient economy would foster the spread of innovative technologicalsolutions, boosting economic growth and creating jobs in severalsectors related to EE (Directive EU, 2012). Kim and Jeong (2016) alsosupport this statement by claiming that improvements in EE can po-sitively influence job creation in the related industries",17321,17678,http://diging.asu.edu/uri/leuphana244,2

"bringing in private sector specific knowledge andresources is a critical step in supporting the programme objectives bystrengthening market mechanisms or applying market-style govern-ance and tools. In the Croatian case, this happened through the in-clusion of energy audits and an EE credit line with low tax schemes insupport of energy investment projects. Consequently, EE measuressuch as subsidies, incentives for energy efficient technologies, tax le-vies/subsidies and loan guarantees",56573,57070,http://diging.asu.edu/uri/leuphana244,2
